# vrp_adv_garages
## vRPex only

This script is not easy to be configured, please pay atention to the cfg file and read every commentary on it.  

This replaces the basic_garages from vRP. It's about the same code but modified to accept multiple garage types for each garage.  

Since this replaces the vRP garages comment your cfg.garages list in vRP.
